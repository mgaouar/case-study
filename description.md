# Case Background Information:

You are part of a senior leadership Engineering team in a company that provides a multi-national messaging system that is used by millions of customers on a daily basis. The company has been experiencing rapid growth and is anticipating up to a 100x increase in daily usage over the next 3 years. Customers utilize the messaging system on 2 different mobile platforms (e.g., iOS, Android) and on the web, with approximately equal usage. The company built the web and iOS solutions in-house; they acquired a competitor that had a messaging system for Android to support Android. As of today, messages cannot be sent to/from Android to/from web or iOS. The customer support team has been receiving increased complaints about service outages, dropped messages, high user perceived latency and the lack of cross-platform communication. You have been asked to provide a near-term solution to address the service outages and increased latency as well as designing and proposing a plan for longer-term solution to enable cross-platform messaging. The long-term solution should leverage a cloud-based service platform architecture that will allow multiple divisions of the company to leverage the messaging system. For this exercise, you should assume that your existing team is fully loaded with existing work but have the ability to obtain all resources and/or headcount necessary to complete the case.

# For this exercise, we are seeking you to cover:

1. Provide an assessment of the situation and how you would approach it with your team.

2. Explain how you would handle pressing issues while working towards a long-term solution.

3. What would the long-term platform architecture look like? How will you work with the engineering team and the business owners to ensure that the platform is built to industry standards and meet the needs of the customers?

4. How will you ensure the platform is scalable, secure, and reliable? What architecture design pattern(s) would you choose for the platform and why?

5. What would you do to ensure that your recommendations are aligned with current and future company business needs?

6. Identify the risks in your recommended approach and how you might mitigate them.

7. Describe how you would ensure that the team is delivering high-quality software and aligned with the long-term vision.

8. What mechanisms would you put in place to prevent future occurrences of issues such as this?

 

# Case Considerations:

You may prepare your case study in whatever format you prefer (e.g., a Word narrative or a PowerPoint presentation). You are welcome to structure the content in whatever way you feel would best convey your ideas and help guide the discussion. Please consider the following:

· We are interested in how you would lead this initiative – no code is expected or required.

· Bias towards clarity of thought over exhaustive detail - be precise and concise.

· We have allocated 90 minutes for the case study review and Q&A.

· We recommend limiting any prepared content to require no more than 30 minutes to review.

· Please state any assumptions that you’ve made.

If you have any clarifying questions, please reach out to JL Dery, VP Engineering and he will help you out (jl.d@ecobee.com).
